          👋Greetings! I'm Derrick, a passionate computer science student at
            Colby College, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts degree, set to graduate
            in May 2026🎓.  My tech journey is fueled by an insatiable love for
            problem-solving and creating impactful solutions through code💻🚀 .
            Beyond coding, I'm an active member of the Colby Hackers Club, where
            I've participated in several hackathons, building innovative
            products🏆🔧. Additionally, I mentor middle school students👨‍🏫📚
            in the WJHS Coding Club, introducing them to the fascinating world
            of computer science concepts. When I'm not immersed in coding or
            mentoring, I enjoy exploring new places, meeting new people, and
            embracing diverse cultures🌍✈️🤝. I also have a passion for soccer
            ⚽🎮, both playing on the field and on the console during my free
            time. It's a great way to unwind and recharge. Thank you for taking
            the time to read this, and I look forward to connecting with you!
            😊🤝
